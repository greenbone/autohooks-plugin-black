An [autohooks](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks) plugin for python code
formatting via [black](https://github.com/ambv/black).

## Installation

### Install using pip

Python Package Index using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/):

    python3 -m pip install autohooks-plugin-black

### Install using poetry

It is highly encouraged to use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for
maintaining your project's dependencies. Normally autohooks-plugin-black is
installed as a development dependency.

## Usage

To activate the black autohooks plugin please add the following setting to your
*pyproject.toml* file.

```toml
[tool.autohooks]
pre-commit = ["autohooks.plugins.black"]
```

By default, autohooks plugin black checks all files with a *.py* ending. If only
files in a sub-directory or files with different endings should be formatted,
just add the following setting:

```toml
[tool.autohooks]
pre-commit = ["autohooks.plugins.black"]

[tool.autohooks.plugins.black]
include = ['foo/*.py', '*.foo']
```

Also by default, autohooks plugin black executes black with the `-q` argument.
If e.g. the generated patch should be shown the following setting can be used:

```toml
[tool.autohooks]
pre-commit = ["autohooks.plugins.black"]

[tool.autohooks.plugins.black]
arguments = ["-q", "--diff"]
```
